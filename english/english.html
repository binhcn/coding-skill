in addition to the den it has three bedrooms what about the one on route 9n it looks like it's big with a library and a deck but it doesn't say how much it costs or anything else about it oh yes mrs gayla's apartment that one is actually only a 10 month rental and it is going for 156 dollars per week it's quite a nice place she only rents for 10 months each year because of horse racing season then her relatives all come to stay so tenants have to move out it's a little bit inconvenient but past tenants have really enjoyed their stay there oh well we need it for a full year i guess that one is out how about the rental on broad drive how many rooms does that one have as it says on the list it has two bedrooms and a private kitchen and bath but it's actually a very small place that's why it's a bit cheaper oh well then what about the one that has three large rooms who is renting that property that one is a good deal mr john smith is renting it but he's quite eccentric and he has a strict rule about no pets how about cats nope absolutely no pets well then how about this studio apartment rented by mr bo jensen how is that one that ad is actually a bit deceptive the studio apartment is the whole upper floor of an older house it's actually very large and at 45 dollars a week quite affordable and it's near campus i think i'd like to check that one out do you have a telephone number that we can call it's not on the list oh it isn't here it is you should ring area code 518 and then 543-790 thanks i think i'll call on that one first your friend decides that he would like to talk to mr bo jensen before you hear the rest of the talk you have some time to look at questions eight to ten now listen and answer questions eight to ten hello one five one two route nine yes is this mr jensen yes it is can i help you yeah we're studying here at university and we came across the rental information for the studio apartment that you are renting is it still available yes of course i actually just placed the ad and you're the first person to call is there anything you'd like to know about it yes actually there is as students we are on the internet a lot and we heard that some homes in the area have high speed connections what type of connection do you have there now oh that's an interesting first question but i guess i have heard that too but we just have a phone line here nothing fancy i think you can have a cable line installed but it's just a phone line for now okay well maybe we can do that what type of heating does the apartment have now there's a more traditional question we have oil heat here it's an older house that tends to be a little more expensive during the winter right yeah but there's nothing to do about it it would cost too much for me to put in a gas heater what else would you like to know about the apartment well we heard it was quite big is it furnished actually yes i should have put that in the ad it has an old couch and a couple chairs a dining table refrigerator stove and even a dishwasher does it have any beds yep it has two that sounds great when is the apartment available you can have it tomorrow night if you want i just have to clean up a couple things before you get here do you want to come over and see it first no it sounds fine to us i actually know the street too so i know the area we'll take it that is

i wish we had gone to you there but we're very glad you're all here let me say further that this will be our largest conference yet registrations have far surpassed our expectations for the first three days we will be hosting more than 325 participants for lectures and workshops another 100 will be joining us for our final two days and culminating session on friday evening we also have a larger selection of seminars than ever a total of 32. because we know that you all will want to attend a few special sessions we will repeat key seminars each day so there will actually be 38 sessions i'm sure you will all be pleased with the content and the quality of speakers before you hear the rest of the talk you have some time to look at questions 16 to 20. now listen and answer questions 16 to 20. now for those who have opted not to take part in our bag lunches there are a number of places nearby that we can recommend we are located here in the convention center just across the street from the harford shopping mall and the place we most recommend is vitals which is just west across queen street on the opposite corner please be careful crossing both streets however as we don't want to lose any participants if you're not up to fatales you can also get some italian food at the olive garden which is further down queen street and east on danning avenue across from the police station they have a great minestrone soup and excellent breadsticks all you can eat on the other hand if you want some good old american food you can head to fuddruckers for some big hamburgers or to the cattle company for some fat juicy steak fuddruckers is next to the olive garden but the cattle company is back closer to us in the opposite direction of vittel's just go east out of the convention center across king street it's on the same side as the convention center so you just have one street to cross enjoy but also please make sure you are back for the afternoon sessions these will always start at 1 30 pm that will give you an hour and a half for lunch each day sessions will be over each day at 5 30. now regarding the schedules we've printed out there have been a couple of last minute changes the session titled new leadership strategies will no longer be held in seminar room 1 but in the main ballroom this session has garnered much praise and is highly recommended to all hence the change to a larger room another session has been cancelled that session was titled leading by serving and it was scheduled for daniel's room the speaker for that session dr mark green had to return home for some urgent health situation we wish the best to dr green and that all is fine with his family finally the session titled using the arts and media has been changed to the second lounge room lounge two please show up promptly for sessions and sit towards the front of each room so that all seats can be utilized also turn off all pagers beepers and cell phones drinks and snacks will be provided outside each room but please be careful at your tables enjoy the conference that is the end of part two you now have half a minute to check your answers now turns to part three part three now turns to part three part three you will hear peter walsh being interviewed for a job listen and choose the correct answer for each question first you have some time to look at questions 21-25 now listen carefully and answer questions 21 to 25 joanne hi you must be rob nice to meet you so i hear you're planning to visit australia yeah and i really wanted to talk to you because i was thinking of spending some time in darwin and my sister told me you're from there that's right so tell me about it well where shall i start well darwin's in what they call the top end because it's right up at the northern end of australia and it's quite different from the rest of australia in terms of cultural influences in fact it's nearer to jakarta and indonesia than it is to sydney so you get a very strong asian influence there that means we get lots of tourists people from other parts of australia are attracted by this sort of international cosmopolitan image and as well as that we've got the same laid-back atmosphere you get all over australia probably more so if anything because of the climate but what a lot of the tourists don't realize until they get there is that the city's also got a very young population the average age is just 29 and this makes the whole place very buzzy some people think that there might not be that much going on as far as art music dancing and so on are concerned because it's so remote i mean we don't really get things like theater and opera in the same way as cities down in the south like sydney for example because of the transport expenses but in fact what happens is that we just do it ourselves lots of people play music classical as well as pop and there are things like artist groups and writers groups and dance classes everyone does something we don't just sit and watch other people you said it's very international yeah they say there are over 70 different nationalities in darwin for instance there's been a chinese population there for over 100 years we've even got a chinese temple it was built way back in 1887 but when a very bad storm a cyclone in fact hit darwin in the 1970s it was almost completely destroyed the only parts of the temple that survived were part of the altars and the stone lions but after the storm they reconstructed it using modern materials it's still used as a religious center today but it's open to tourists too and it's definitely worth going to see it oh and as far as getting around goes you'll see the places that advertise bicycles for hire but i wouldn't recommend it a lot of the year it's just so hot and humid some tourists think it'll be fine because there's not much in the way of hills and the traffic's quite light compared with some places but believe me you're better off with public transport it's fine and not expensive or you can hire a car but it's not really worth it what's the swimming like well there are some good beaches but the trouble is that there's this nasty creature called the box jellyfish and if it stings you you're in bad trouble so you have to be very careful most of the year especially in the winter months you can wear a lycra suit to cover your arms and legs but i wouldn't like to risk it even so personally and there are the salt saltwater crocodiles too i mean i don't want to put you off there are protected swimming areas netted off where you'll be safe from jellyfish and crocs or there are the public swimming pools they're fine of course before you hear the rest of the talk you have some time to look at questions 26 to 30. now listen and answer questions 26 to 30. and answer the questions please sit down mr walsh my name's jane swain and i'm the personnel manager hello how do you do now this is just a short preliminary interview i'd like to chat about your present job and what you've done up till now yes of course well could you tell me how long you've had your present position in westin's it is westin's isn't it yes that's right um i am not sure let's see i left university in 2005. is that right yes 2005. then i was unemployed for about three months and then i traveled around america for a few months so yes it must be about three years now in fact yes and have you any particular reason for wanting to change jobs i mean why do you want to move well i actually like my present job and still find it interesting and stimulating the salary is okay so it's nothing to do with money though you can always do with more i suppose the thing is that i'm really very ambitious and keen to get promoted so that's the real reason you say you like your job can you tell me what aspect you like most oh my dear that's difficult there are so many things the other people are great there's a good cooperative atmosphere i mean among the staff and compared to other companies the conditions are great i mean the office itself and the working conditions hmm and then there's the fact that they give me lots of room for initiative and let me make decisions you know that's what i really like most about the job yes well we're looking for someone like that you know someone who isn't a clock watcher and who isn't too concerned about working fairly long hours oh i don't mind that i'm used to it and what about your education you went to manchester university didn't you yes after leaving school i started a diploma course in design but i decided to give it up and did an arts degree at university instead good and have you done any courses since that is the end of part three you now have half a minute to check your answers now turns to part four part four you'll hear a teacher talking about several british art galleries first you have some time to look at questions 31-33 now listen carefully and answer questions 31-33 good afternoon welcome to the first class of v100 art and history the objectives of the course as you will have seen if you've taken a look at the syllabus include familiarizing yourselves with the vocabulary and language of art learning about the basic elements of art and design and finally discussing historical periods as they pertain to art the course will also give you the opportunity to visit some of the many galleries and museums that britain has to offer so having said that i'd like to spend the rest of today's class talking about four of the more important galleries that we will be visiting in the coming year as most of you already know or at least i hope most of you know there are four tate galleries in all to begin i'd like to tell you a little bit about the tate modern tate modern is located in a very busy part of london called the south bank it's close to two world-renowned tourist attractions st paul's cathedral and shakespeare's globe theater now interestingly enough tate modern is housed in what was a power station built in several stages between 1947 and 1963. it was closed down in 1981 and reopened as a gallery in the year 2000 tape modern consists of five levels with the tate collection being shown on the third and fifth levels on level two the works of contemporary artists are exhibited while level four is used for holding large temporary exhibitions since this museum opened it has become a popular spot for both londoners and tourists alike and believe it or not it doesn't cost anything to get in to see the collection displays before you hear the rest of the talk you have some time to look at questions 34 to 40. now listen and answer questions 34 to 40. now the second gallery i'd like to talk about is tate saint ives which is in cornwall it was built on the site of a gas works and it overlooks porthmeor beach tate saint ives is housed in a three-story building that was designed by the architects evans and shalif it was established in 1993 seven years before tate modern was opened and the gallery exhibits the works of modern british artists including members of the saint ive school a group of artists living and working in the area from the 30s onwards in later lectures we'll be looking at the work of some of the artists who belong to that group and the ways in which they influenced each other okay am i going too fast for any of you no good next i want to talk about tate britain which is a gorgeous gallery situated right in the heart of westminster tate britain was the first of the four tate galleries to open and it was established in 1897. it was built on the site of an old prison and when it first opened its doors it was called the national gallery of british art later it became known as the tate gallery after the man who founded it sir henry tate during its lifetime tate britain has been damaged twice once by flood waters from the river thames and once by bombings during world war ii this gallery has an interesting range of exhibitions of historic and modern art from 1500 up to the present day now the last gallery i'd like to tell you about is called tate liverpool it's not hard to figure out where this gallery is located is it it was opened in 1988 to exhibit displays from the tate collection and it also has a program of temporary exhibitions tate liverpool is housed in what was once a warehouse and for some years it was one of the biggest galleries of modern and contemporary art in the uk well that's a brief overview of just a few of the galleries we'll be visiting i'd like now to look in a little more detail at what you can expect to see in each of these galleries starting with tate britain that is the end of part four you now have half a minute to check your [Music] answers that is the end of the test you now have 10 minutes to
